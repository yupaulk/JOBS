Description: We propose a JOint model viewing Bk-eQTLs as a weighted sum of Sc-eQTLs (JOBS) from constituent cell types. JOBS borrows strength from large sample sizes of bk-eQTLs to improve sc-eQTLs analysis, with improvements bigger for more common cell types. With more accurate sc-eQTLs effect estimates, all integrative analyses can be improved.
