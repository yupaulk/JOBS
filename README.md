## Introduction
Here, we propose a JOint model viewing Bk-eQTLs as a weighted sum of Sc-eQTLs (JOBS) from constituent cell types. JOBS borrows strength from large sample sizes of bk-eQTLs to improve sc-eQTLs analysis, with improvements bigger for more common cell types. With more accurate sc-eQTLs effect estimates, all integrative analyses can be improved.
 
It is developed and maintained by Lida Wang at [Dajiang Liu's Group](https://dajiangliu.blog).

## Installation
The package is hosted on github, which allows installation and update to be very easy. First, make sure you have the dplyr, data.table, and tidyr packages installed.

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then you could install JOBS from the repository here.

```
devtools::install_github("LidaWangPSU/JOBS/JOBS")
library(JOBS)
```
Here we go.

## Quick tutorial
### Prepare bulk and single cell eQTLs summary statistics (effect size and s.e.). 

We have example input data [here](https://github.com/LidaWangPSU/JOBS/blob/main/example_data/). Data were subsetted from brain bulk and single cell eQTLs as an example to run the script.

Input includes
* Effect size: A matrix of eqtls across bulk and single cell, first col: gene-snp pair; second col: bulk effect size; 3+ cols: cell type specific eqtls
* S.E.: The same dimension matrix of eqtls standard deviation across bulk and single cell, first col: gene-snp pair; second col: bulk effect size se; 3+ col: cell type specific eqtls se. S.E. file should be 1-1 match with effect size

(It is acceptable to have missing data in the input. We will analyze all gene-SNP pairs unless sc-eQTL data is entirely missing for all cell types. In other cases, we will simply ignore the missing values and keep "NA" in the output.)

|    Gene-snp pair    |      Bulk     | Cell type 1  |  Cell type 2 | ...... |  Cell type k |
| ------------------- |      ----     | -----------  |  ----------- | ------ |  ----------- |
| ENSG00000XXXXX-snp1 | xx(beta or se)|xx(beta or se)|xx(beta or se)| ...... |xx(beta or se)|  
| ENSG00000XXXXX-snp2 | xx(beta or se)|xx(beta or se)|xx(beta or se)| ...... |xx(beta or se)|
```
library(data.table)
beta <- as.data.frame(fread("~/example_beta_chr22.txt.gz"))
se <- as.data.frame(fread("~/example_beta_se_chr22.txt.gz"))
```
  
### Run JOBS
```
jobs_eqtls <- jobs(beta,se)
```

### Output results
The output includes:
* Cell type weights: weights for each cell types
* Refined effect size: in the same format as effect size input
* Refined S.E:in the same format as s.e. input
